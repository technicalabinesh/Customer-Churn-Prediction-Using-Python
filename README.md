# Customer Churn Prediction Using Python

## Project Overview
Customer churn is a critical issue for many businesses, especially subscription-based services and telecom companies. This project focuses on analyzing customer data to predict which customers are likely to discontinue their service, also known as “churning.” By accurately predicting churn, businesses can proactively engage at-risk customers with retention campaigns, personalized offers, or improved customer service, ultimately reducing revenue loss and increasing customer lifetime value.

## Dataset
The dataset used contains detailed customer information collected by the company, including demographic data, account information, service usage, billing details, and whether the customer churned. Typical columns include:

- CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer  
- Gender: Male or Female  
- Age or SeniorCitizen: Customer age or senior status  
- Tenure: Number of months the customer has been with the company  
- Services: Types of subscribed services (internet, phone, streaming, etc.)  
- Payment Method: How the customer pays (credit card, electronic check, etc.)  
- Monthly Charges: Amount charged monthly  
- Total Charges: Total amount charged to date  
- Churn: Target variable indicating if the customer left (Yes/No)

## Business Objective
The primary goal is to build a predictive model that accurately identifies customers who are likely to churn. This insight enables the business to:

- Target retention efforts more effectively  
- Reduce churn rate and associated costs  
- Improve customer satisfaction through personalized interventions  
- Maximize revenue and profitability by maintaining a loyal customer base

## Challenges Addressed
- Handling missing or inconsistent data values  
- Encoding categorical variables for machine learning algorithms  
- Managing class imbalance if churned customers are fewer than retained ones  
- Selecting relevant features and avoiding overfitting  
- Choosing and tuning appropriate machine learning models for best performance

## Tools & Technologies
- Python 3.x programming language  
- Pandas and NumPy for data loading, cleaning, and manipulation  
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for exploratory data analysis and visualization  
- Scikit-learn for building, evaluating, and tuning machine learning models  
- XGBoost for advanced gradient boosting classifier with improved accuracy

## Methodology

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Assess data quality and completeness  
- Visualize feature distributions and relationships  
- Analyze churn rates across different customer segments

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Handle missing or anomalous values  
- Convert categorical features using one-hot encoding or label encoding  
- Scale numerical features where necessary  
- Split data into training and testing sets to evaluate model generalization

### 3. Feature Engineering & Selection
- Create new features if applicable (e.g., average charges, tenure buckets)  
- Use correlation analysis and feature importance to select impactful variables

### 4. Model Training and Tuning
- Train models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost  
- Optimize hyperparameters using Grid Search or Random Search  
- Address class imbalance using techniques like SMOTE or class weighting if needed

### 5. Model Evaluation
- Use metrics including Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC  
- Analyze confusion matrix to understand error types  
- Select the best model based on overall performance and business needs

### 6. Insights & Recommendations
- Identify key drivers of churn  
- Suggest actionable steps for customer retention  
- Communicate findings with visualizations and clear explanations

## Results Summary
- The best model achieved around 85-90% accuracy in predicting churn  
- Important features influencing churn include tenure, monthly charges, contract type, and payment method  
- Visualization of ROC curves demonstrated good trade-off between sensitivity and specificity  
- Recommendations provided for marketing and customer service teams to focus on high-risk customers

## Future Work & Improvements
- Incorporate additional customer behavior data for better prediction  
- Implement real-time churn prediction in production environments  
- Develop personalized retention campaigns based on customer segmentation  
- Explore deep learning models like neural networks for potentially improved accuracy  
- Automate data pipeline for continuous model retraining and monitoring

## How to Run
1. Install required Python libraries:  
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn xgboost
Load the dataset and open the Jupyter Notebook or Python script.

Run the analysis step-by-step to reproduce the exploratory data analysis, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

Modify parameters or try different models to experiment with performance.
